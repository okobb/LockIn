Part 3: 30-Day MVP Feature Roadmap
Constraint: Total dev time must not exceed 30 days. Features are prioritized by core value proposition impact.
Prioritized Feature Table
#	Feature Name	Priority	Est. Days	Justification
WEEK 1: Core Briefing				
1	User Auth (Clerk)	P0	1	Foundation - required for all other features
2	GitHub OAuth + Repo Selection	P0	1.5	Enables core "Context Restoration" with code diffs
3	Git Diff Extraction & Display	P0	2	Core value prop - "Where was I?" with syntax highlighting
4	Basic Dashboard UI	P0	1.5	Single-page brief of daily priorities (dashboard.html)
5	Calendar Integration (Read-Only)	P1	1	"Today's Schedule" timeline in dashboard.html
	Subtotal		7 days	
WEEK 2: Context Save/Restore				
6	Chrome Extension (Tab Capture)	P0	2	"Lock In" button captures browser state
7	Context Snapshot Save API	P0	1	Backend storage for context_snapshots table
8	Context Restore Flow	P0	2	ContextRestore.html - restores tabs + shows diff
9	Context History Page	P1	1	ContextHistory.html - timeline of saved contexts
10	Basic Notification Push	P1	1	Web Push API for urgent alerts
	Subtotal		7 days	
WEEK 3: Voice + AI Synthesis				
11	Voice Memo Recording (Browser API)	P0	1.5	MediaRecorder in Chrome extension
12	Whisper Transcription Integration	P0	1	n8n workflow: audio → transcription
13	AI Resume Checklist Generation	P0	2	GPT-4o-mini: diff + transcript → checklist
14	Focus Mode Timer UI	P0	1.5	tasks.html - Pomodoro timer with pause/resume
15	Checklist Items CRUD	P1	1	Add/complete items in Mission Checklist
	Subtotal		7 days	
WEEK 4: Knowledge Layer Lite + Polish				
16	Save URL Feature	P1	1	Basic URL saving with metadata extraction
17	RAG Lite (Keyword Search)	P2	2	Keyword matching instead of full embeddings
18	Proactive Suggestion Card	P1	1	"You saved X article..." on dashboard.html
19	Daily Stats Aggregation	P1	1	Flow Time, Deep Work Blocks tracking
20	Slack Integration (Basic)	P1	2	Read @mentions for priority extraction
21	Onboarding + Landing Polish	P1	1	OnBoarding.html, landing.html refinement
22	Context Quality Score	P2	0.5	Quick win feature from Part 2
	Subtotal		8.5 days	
Total: 29.5 days ✅
________________________________________
"RAG Lite" Note
Full RAG with pgvector embeddings is scoped at ~5-6 days (embedding generation, vector indexing, semantic search). For the MVP, I recommend "RAG Lite":
Full RAG	RAG Lite
OpenAI embeddings	PostgreSQL trigram search
pgvector similarity	Keyword + metadata matching
Semantic "similar concepts"	Exact topic tag matching
~5-6 days	~2 days
This delivers 80% of the value by leveraging AI-extracted metadata.topics for matching without the embedding pipeline overhead. Full RAG can be added in Month 2.

Summary
What Was Created
1.	Complete PostgreSQL schema with 13 tables supporting all UI requirements
2.	4 new tables to fill gaps: focus_sessions, checklist_items, daily_stats, notification_logs
3.	7 columns added via Gap Analysis: users.urgent_keywords, context_snapshots.created_at, context_snapshots.voice_duration_sec, context_snapshots.voice_recorded_at, context_snapshots.git_files_changed, daily_stats.estimated_time_saved_min, incoming_messages.received_at
4.	Quick Win feature: Context Quality Score (6-8 hours)
5.	30-day MVP roadmap totaling 29.5 days with P0-P2 prioritization
Key Design Decisions
•	JSONB flexibility for evolving schema (browser_state, metadata, preferences)
•	Denormalized daily_stats for efficient dashboard rendering
•	RAG Lite to ship knowledge feature without full embedding pipeline
•	Trigger-based stats updates to maintain data consistency
IMPORTANT
The schema supports the "Senior Engineer Persona" through the knowledge_embeddings table with pgvector, but the full semantic search implementation is deferred to post-MVP per the roadmap constraints.
